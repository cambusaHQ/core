# Cambusa

ðŸš£ A modern, high-performance web framework built with Bun and modern JavaScript.

##Â Introduction

Cambusa is a web framework designed to provide a comfortable developer experience with modern JavaScript syntax and enhanced performance using Bun as the runtime. Inspired by Sails.js, if you want to build applications using the latest JavaScript features while enjoying better performance, **Cambusa** is the framework for you.

## Why Cambusa?

In Italian, cambusa means "ship's pantry" or "galley"â€”the place where provisions are stored on a vessel. Just like a cambusa supplies sailors with essential provisions for their journey, this framework aims to supply developers with the essential tools and conventions needed for building scalable and efficient applications.

The name reflects my modest approach to web development, inspired by Sails.js but streamlined for modern development practices.

## Features

- Sails.js-Inspired Conventions: Familiar MVC structure, blueprints, and configuration patterns.
- Modern JavaScript Syntax: Utilize the latest ES modules, async/await, and other modern language features.
- Powered by Bun: Experience significantly faster performance with Bun's high-speed runtime and bundler.
- Flexible Configuration: Manage settings via config files, environment variables, or command-line arguments.
- Automatic Routing: Define routes in configuration files that map directly to controller actions.
- Modular Architecture: Organize your codebase with a clear structure for controllers, services, and utilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun: Make sure you have Bun installed ([installation Guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)).

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (assuming Cambusa is hosted on GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cambusa-app.git
cd cambusa-app

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### Project Structure

```bash
cambusa-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ UserController.js
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ development.js
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ production.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test.js
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routesLoader.js
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ bunfig.toml
```

### Run

```bash
bun run app.js
```

## Configuration

Cambusa uses a flexible configuration system. Configurations are split into files within the `config/` directory, allowing you to manage settings for different aspects of your application, such as server settings, database connections, and custom configurations.

### **Example** config/server.js

```js
export default {
  server: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3000,
  },
};
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

Create environment-specific configuration files in the config/env/ directory to override default settings.

**Example** `config/env/development.js`:

```js
export default {
  server: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3000,
  },
};
```

**Example** `config/env/production.js`:

```js
export default {
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 80,
  },
};
```

## Creating Routes and Controllers

### Defining Routes

Define your application's routes in config/routes.js, mapping HTTP methods and paths to controller actions.

**Example** `config/routes.js`:

```js
export default {
  routes: {
    'GET /users': 'UserController.getUsers',
    'POST /users': 'UserController.createUser',
  },
};
```

### Creating Controllers

Controllers handle the logic for your routes. Place them in the `api/controllers/` directory.

**Example** `api/controllers/UserController.js`:

```js
export async function getUsers({ request, response }) {
  // Your logic to retrieve users
  return [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
  ];
}

export async function createUser({ request, response }) {
  const userData = await request.json();
  // Your logic to create a new user
  const newUser = {
    id: 3, // This would typically be generated by your database
    name: userData.name,
  };
  return newUser;
}
```

## Philosophy

**Cambusa** is born out of a deep appreciation for Sails.js and its developer-friendly conventions. The goal is to replicate that enjoyable development experience using modern JavaScript features and harnessing the performance benefits of Bun. By adopting a modest and essentialist approachâ€”just like a ship's cambusaâ€”we focus on providing only what's necessary to build robust applications without unnecessary complexity.
