# Database

## Supported Databases

You can configure the project to use one of the supported databases:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- SQLite
- MongoDB
- Oracle
- MS SQL

### Configuration

Update the `config/datastore.js` file to define the database connection:

Example with sqlite:

```js
export default {
  database: {
    type: 'sqlite',
    database: './database.sqlite',
  },
};
```

Example with PostgreSQL:

```js
export default {
  database: {
    type: 'postgres', // Example: Switch to PostgreSQL
    url: 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb', // Database connection URL
  },
};
```

The configuration should follow the TypeORM's [Data Source Options](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/data-source-options)

## Models

### Loading Models

Models are automatically loaded from the `api/models/` directory. Each model is defined by exporting a default object that specifies the model's schema using TypeORM's EntitySchema format.

### Model Definition and Types

Cambusa provides support for defining models using a set of common types that map to various database-specific column types. You can define your models in the `api/models` directory.

#### Supported Types

Here are the predefined types you can use when defining columns in your models:

- **string**: Maps to a short string field (e.g., varchar(255) in MySQL, text in PostgreSQL).
- **text**: Maps to the longest possible text field for the target database (e.g., longtext in MySQL, clob in Oracle).
- **integer**: Maps to an integer type (e.g., int in MySQL, integer in PostgreSQL).
- **boolean**: Maps to a boolean value (e.g., tinyint(1) in MySQL, boolean in PostgreSQL).
- **date**: Maps to a date/time field (e.g., timestamp with time zone in PostgreSQL, datetime in MySQL).
- **decimal**: Maps to a decimal type for precise numeric values (e.g., decimal in MySQL, numeric in PostgreSQL).
- **json**: Maps to a JSON field (e.g., jsonb in PostgreSQL, json in MySQL).
- **uuid**: Maps to a UUID type (e.g., uuid in PostgreSQL, char(36) in MySQL).

#### Defining Columns with Types

Each column in a model can be defined with one of the above types. Hereâ€™s an example of defining various column types in a User model:

**Example:** `api/models/User.js`

```js
export default {
  columns: {
    firstName: {
      type: 'string',
      nullable: true,
    },
    lastName: {
      type: 'string',
      nullable: true,
    },
    email: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
    },
    age: {
      type: 'integer',
      nullable: true,
    },
    isActive: {
      type: 'boolean',
      default: true,
    },
  },
};
```

#### Native types

You can optionally specify a `nativeType` for more control over a specific database, if needed. In this case you must use `ref` as `type`.

```js
export default {
  columns: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
    },
    ownerId: {
      type: 'ref',
      nativeType: 'bigint', // Optional: specify native type for the foreign key
    },
  },
};
```

#### Relations

Define relationships (e.g., `one-to-many`, `many-to-one`, `many-to-many`, `one-to-one`) in the `relations` property of your model. These relationships connect models together and are required for associations like joining tables or referencing foreign keys.

**Example**: **many-to-one** relationship

```js
export default {
  columns: {
    orderNumber: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
    },
    totalAmount: {
      type: 'decimal',
    },
  },
  relations: {
    user: {
      type: 'many-to-one',
      target: 'User', // References the User model
      joinColumn: { name: 'userId' },
      onDelete: 'SET NULL',
    },
  },
};
```

**Example** of self-referential relations

```js
export default {
  columns: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
    },
  },
  relations: {
    parent: {
      type: 'many-to-one',
      target: 'Category', // Self-referential relation
      joinColumn: { name: 'parentId' },
      onDelete: 'SET NULL',
    },
  },
};
```

**Example** of bi-directional relations

`api/models/User.js`

```js
export default {
  columns: {
    // columns definition
  },
  relations: {
    posts: {
      type: 'one-to-many',
      target: 'Post',
      inverseSide: 'author',
    },
  },
};
```

`api/models/Post.js`

```js
export default {
  columns: {
    // columns definition
  },
  relations: {
    author: {
      type: 'many-to-one',
      target: 'User', // The target entity is the User model
      inverseSide: 'posts', // Reference to the 'posts' property in the User model
      joinColumn: { name: 'userId' }, // The foreign key column in the Post table
      onDelete: 'CASCADE', // If a user is deleted, the posts are also deleted
    },
  },
};
```

### Automatic Features

Cambusa provides several automatic features to simplify model definitions:

- **Automatic Model Name**: The model name is inferred from the filename. For example, `User.js` results in a model named `User`.
- **Automatic Table Name**: The table name is inferred from the model name, pluralized and lowercased. For example, the `User` model corresponds to the `users` table.
- **Automatic Primary Key**: Unless you set `primaryKey: false` in your model definition, a primary key column is automatically added to your model. The primary key is named `id` (or `_id` for MongoDB), and its type and generation strategy are determined based on the database type.
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamp columns are automatically added to your models unless you set `createdAt: false` or `updatedAt: false` in your model definition. These columns store Unix milliseconds and are automatically managed by TypeORM.

### Customizing Model Definitions

You can override any of the automatic features by specifying them in your model definition.

#### Example with Custom Model Name and Table Name:

```js
export default {
  name: 'UserProfile', // Custom model name
  tableName: 'user_profiles', // Custom table name
  columns: {
    // columns definition
  },
};
```

#### Example Disabling Automatic Primary Key and Timestamps:

```js
export default {
  primaryKey: false, // Disable automatic primary key
  createdAt: false, // Disable automatic createdAt column
  updatedAt: false, // Disable automatic updatedAt column
  columns: {
    // columns definition
  },
};
```

In the above example, we:

- **Disable Automatic Primary Key**: Set `primaryKey: false` and define a custom primary key customId.
- **Disable Automatic Timestamps**: Set `createdAt: false` and `updatedAt: false` to prevent the automatic addition of timestamp columns.

### Accessing Models

You can access models via `cambusa.models.ModelName`.

**Example:**

```js
// Fetch all users
const users = await cambusa.models.User.find();

// Create a new user
const newUser = cambusa.models.User.create({
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
});

await cambusa.models.User.save(newUser);
```

**Notes**

- **Primary Key Generation**: The primary key is generated based on the database type using a helper function. For most SQL databases, it's an auto-incrementing `bigint` named `id`.
- **Timestamps**: The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` columns are automatically managed by TypeORM. They store timestamps in Unix milliseconds and represent the creation and last update times of the records.
- **Disabling Automatic Features**: Set `primaryKey: false`, `createdAt: false`, or `updatedAt: false` in your model definition to disable automatic generation of these features.
- **Custom Columns**: You can define custom columns, including primary keys and timestamps, if you need specific configurations.
- **EntitySchema**: Cambusa uses TypeORM's `EntitySchema` under the hood. You can leverage all of its features for advanced configurations.

#### Example with All Features

`api/models/Comment.js`

```js
export default {
  name: 'Comment',
  tableName: 'comments',
  columns: {
    content: { type: 'text' },
  },
  relations: {
    post: {
      type: 'many-to-one',
      target: 'Post',
      inverseSide: 'comments',
    },
    author: {
      type: 'many-to-one',
      target: 'User',
      inverseSide: 'comments',
    },
  },
};
```

#### Accessing Related Data

You can access related entities using TypeORM's relations.

**Example:**

```js
// Fetch posts with their authors
const posts = await cambusa.models.Post.find({ relations: ['author'] });

// Fetch a user and their posts
const user = await cambusa.models.User.findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  relations: ['posts'],
});

// Create a new comment
const comment = cambusa.models.Comment.create({
  content: 'Great post!',
  author: user,
  post: posts[0],
});

await cambusa.models.Comment.save(comment);
```

## Database Migrations

Cambusa provides commands to manage database migrations, allowing you to version control your database schema changes.

### What are Migrations?

Migrations are scripts that define transformations to your database schema over time. They allow you to:

- **Track Schema Changes**: Keep a history of how your database schema evolves.
- **Collaborate Effectively**: Ensure that all team members apply the same schema changes consistently.
- **Deploy Safely**: Apply schema changes in a controlled manner, reducing the risk of errors.

### Cambusa CLI Migration Commands

Cambusa CLI offers a suite of commands to manage migrations efficiently. Below are the primary commands along with their usage and examples.

1. Creating a Migration

To create a new empty migration file where you can define your schema changes manually:

```bash
bun run bin/cambusa.js migrations:create <MigrationName>
```

**What It Does:**

- **Generates a New Migration File**: Creates a new TypeScript file in the migrations directory, named with a timestamp and the provided migration name.
- **Provides Skeleton Structure**: The file contains empty `up` and `down` methods where you can define the schema transformations.

2. Generating a Migration

To automatically generate a migration based on the differences between your current entity models and the existing database schema:

```bash
bun run bin/cambusa.js migrations:generate <MigrationName>
```

**What It Does:**

- **Compares Models with Database**: Analyzes your entity models and identifies changes compared to the current database schema.
- **Generates Migration Steps**: Automatically creates a migration file with the necessary SQL commands to apply the detected changes.
- **Handles Both Up and Down Migrations**: Ensures that the migration can be both applied (`up`) and reverted (`down`).

**Notes:**

- **Review Generated Migrations**: Always inspect the generated migration files to ensure they accurately reflect the intended changes.
- **Manual Adjustments**: You can manually tweak the migration files if needed, especially for complex transformations.

3. Running Migrations

To apply all pending migrations to your database:

```bash
bun run bin/cambusa.js migrations:run
```

**What It Does:**

- **Applies Pending Migrations**: Executes all migration files that haven't been applied yet, updating your database schema accordingly.
- **Updates Migration History**: Keeps track of applied migrations to prevent reapplying them in the future.

**Notes:**

- **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure that migrations are idempotent to prevent issues when running them multiple times.
- **Order Matters**: Migrations are applied in the order they are created, typically based on their timestamps.

### Database Synchronization (db:sync)

Database synchronization is a feature provided by TypeORM that allows automatic synchronization of your entity models with the database schema. While it can be convenient during development, it comes with significant caveats, especially concerning data integrity and control over schema changes.

#### What is db:sync?
- **Automatic Schema Updates**: db:sync automatically generates and applies schema changes to your database based on your entity models whenever your application starts.
- **Development Convenience**: It reduces the need to manually manage migrations during the initial development phase.

#### How Does db:sync Work in TypeORM?

When `synchronize: true` is set in your TypeORM data source options, TypeORM performs the following actions on application startup:

1. **Schema Comparison**: Compares the current entity models with the existing database schema.
2. **Automatic Updates**: Applies necessary changes to align the database schema with the models. This includes creating tables, adding or removing columns, and altering column types.
3. **No Migration History Tracking**: Unlike migrations, db:sync does not keep track of applied changes, making it unsuitable for production environments.

**Notes:**

- **Development Only**: It's strongly recommended to use db:sync only in development environments. Avoid using it in production to prevent unintended schema changes and potential data loss.
- **Performance Considerations**: Automatic synchronization can impact application startup time, especially for large schemas.
- **Limited Control**: db:sync does not provide granular control over schema changes, making it difficult to manage complex migrations.
